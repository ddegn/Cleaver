Cleaver
=======

Personal programs to control robot with Arlo hardware.
The object "Cleaver.spin" will run on a Propeller Activity Board.
The Object "CleaverSlave.spin" will be used on a second Propeller board. This second board is my own design but any Propeller board which allows one to connect to any of it's pins may be used.

The "Cleaver.spin" code uses many of the same objects and methods used by the Eddie firmware. The "Cleaver.spin" and "CleaverSlave.spin" objects will be used with the same robot I'm using to test the Eddie firmware.

As of today (January 6, 2015) the two objects do not communicate with each other.

I've calling the robot this code will be used on "Cleaver". I have a robot page on Let's Make Robots where photos and videos of this robot have been posted. Here's a the link:

The Eddie firmware is being developed as part of the Open Propeller Project #8. Here's the link to the thread discussing this project.
